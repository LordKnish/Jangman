Hangman made in java with lots of love.


This was a project for my AP Comp Sci class. The code is messy but i put a ton of effort into it and it really challenged me to learn new things about java that i never knew. 

How to install
1. Download the java files and open it with your editor of choice
2. Do not forget the words.txt file. That is the dictionary. Eventually i will most likely create and HTTP server and make it get the words that way but for now it is a physical file.
3. Run it and have fun!

If you have any questions feel free to message me.
